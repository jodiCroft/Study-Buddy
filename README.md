Study Buddy - Flatiron Final Project

Study Buddy is an online flashcard generator for people of all ages to create, browse and study flashcards in any subject. I have a passion for education, and wanted to base my final project around something that I am apssionate about and will continue to work on and improve.

Study Buddy was built with a Rails and SQLite3 backend and a React and Javascript frontend. I used Rails sessions and bcrypt for Authentication on the backend and React Router for client routing on the frontend.

To get started:
1. Run bundle install in the rails terminal
2. Run rails s to start the server
3. Run npm install in a new terminal
4. Run npm start to start the rails server on the frontend
